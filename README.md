# Response-Time-in-Two-Languages
A small helper for an experiment that expands on F. S. Donder's experiment regarding response time, participants of 
varying levels of fluency in English and Spanish will take a quiz and results are plotted as accuracy vs fluency.

Hypothesis for this experiment: People who are mostly fluent in both English and Spanish will perform worse than those
who are mainly fluent in English when asked to determine relationships between words in English and Spanish

Experiment: 
1) Ask the participant how fluent they are in Spanish, on a scale from 1 to 5, 5 being fluent and 1 being barely
   knowledgeable of simple vocabulary
3) Have them take the coded part of the experiment
    - Two words will appear on the screen, input 1 if they are opposites/not related, or 2 if they are similar/related
    - The objective of this experiment is to time their responses and measure the accuracy of their answers
4) Analyze the average response times and percent accuracies and compare that to their level of fluency


Results:

Analysis:
- Generally, the people with less knowledge of Spanish performed better based on percent of questions answered correctly
- The data for average times based on fluency was inconclusive
- The people who were most fluent in Spanish (Ava, Luis, and Henry) performed the worst based on their accuracy

Conclusion:
While the correlation between fluency in another language and average reaction time is unclear, this experiment reflected 
that participants who were not very knowledgeable of Spanish (1-3 on the scale) generally produced more accurate responses
than those who were fluent in both English and Spanish.

Thoughts to better the experiment:
- Have a wider pool of participants, with the same numbers of participants in the fluency categories
- Change the word bank to simpler words that wonâ€™t cause confusion (ex: comparing chair and table and novel and new)
- Have a bigger word bank to have more accurate results for average time
